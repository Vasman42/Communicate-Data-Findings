# Intro
In this project we analyse the PISA study of 2012. The PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) is a worldwide study by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to evaluate different educational systems. 15-year-old pupils from different countries were measured on mathematics, science and reading.

# What is being analysed?

In this project we would like to gain more insight into the possible influences of age and sex. Above all, we would like to learn more about the possible hurdles that may arise from the role of parents, family structure and a migration background.

# Insights and conclusion.

In summary, it can be said that the individual characteristics analysed (age, gender, family situation, immigration status and cultural background) always have a certain share in the results.

For example, we could observe that the youngest participants in the data set had significantly worse results. We also see that girls and boys seem to have different strengths and weaknesses depending on their sex.

The role of parents also plays a very important role. If both parents are at home, the students achieve significantly better results than if there are no parents in the house. Students with parents from different cultural backgrounds also seem to be slightly better.

At first glance, the migration background did not seem to have much influence on the results. But if you look at the individual European countries in comparison, you can see that it has different influences from country to country. The immigrant background can be a significant hurdle to good results, depending on the country you grow up in.
